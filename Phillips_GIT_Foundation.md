## I. STARTING PROPOSITIONS

Three claims from which everything else derives:

### P1: Information Is Ontologically Primary

**Statement**: The irreducible constituent of reality is information—distinguishable states that can influence other states. What we call matter, energy, and spacetime are stable patterns in underlying information structure.

**Why this must be assumed**: Without an ontological primitive, we have infinite regress. Traditional physics assumes matter/energy as primitive but cannot explain why general relativity and quantum mechanics—both successful—are incompatible. Taking information as primitive dissolves this: both GR (geometry) and QM (quantum states) describe aspects of information structure.

**Empirical anchor**: Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S = A/4l_P² establishes that black hole information content equals surface area in Planck units. The holographic principle generalizes this: information in any volume is bounded by surface area. This is not about our knowledge but about reality's structure.

**What it rules out**: Substance metaphysics. The claim that "stuff" exists independent of information relations.

---

### P2: Dual Entropic Drives Govern All Dynamics

**Statement**: Every system's evolution is shaped by two tendencies operating simultaneously:
- **Dispersive (EPO-D)**: Toward maximum entropy, uniform distribution, thermal equilibrium
- **Integrative (EPO-I)**: Toward increased information integration, pattern formation, structural complexity

**Why this must be assumed**: The Second Law (dispersive drive) is established physics. But it cannot explain why structure exists at all—why galaxies, life, and minds appear in a universe trending toward heat death. Standard physics calls structure a "local fluctuation." This proposition elevates structure-formation to equally fundamental status.

**Empirical anchor**: 
- Vopson's second law of infodynamics: information entropy decreases over time (= integrative drive stated information-theoretically)
- England's dissipation-driven adaptation: systems under energy flux self-organize to maximize entropy production (structure accelerates overall entropy flow)
- Universal observation: structure exists despite Second Law

**What it rules out**: Single-drive thermodynamics. The claim that entropy increase is the only fundamental tendency.

---

### P3: The Universe Is Self-Contained and Self-Referential

**Statement**: The universe is a closed system with no external environment. Initial conditions, boundary conditions, and physical regularities emerge from internal consistency requirements rather than external imposition. Observers are participants in the system being observed.

**Why this must be assumed**: Without closure, any puzzle can be "solved" by appeal to external factors (multiverse, designer, random initial conditions). This makes theories unfalsifiable. Closure demands that the universe regulate itself—the cosmological constant, initial conditions, and physical laws must all be internally determined.

**Empirical anchor**: 
- Cosmological constant: 10^120 discrepancy between QFT prediction and observation cannot be solved by external cancellation; internal regulation required
- Wheeler's participatory universe: observation is universe processing information about itself
- Quantum measurement: observer-system entanglement, not external intervention

**What it rules out**: External explanation. Appeals to pre-existing laws, external designers, or multiverse selection.

## II. DERIVED CLAIMS

Everything below follows necessarily from P1 + P2 + P3:

### D1: Convexity Is Mathematically Required for Stable Equilibrium

**Derivation**: When P2's dual drives reach balance, stable equilibrium forms. But equilibrium REQUIRES convex geometry:

1. **Thermodynamic stability** (Legendre duality): Energy U(S,V,N) must be convex for stability. Non-convex energy → system fragments. Entropy S(U,V,N) must be concave. Legendre transform preserves convex-concave duality.

2. **Strategic stability** (Kakutani theorem): Nash equilibrium exists iff strategy spaces are convex. Non-convex spaces → best-response cycles with no fixed point.

3. **Transport optimality** (Brenier theorem): Optimal mass transport T = ∇φ where φ is convex. Non-convex potentials → suboptimal allocation.

**Logical status**: NECESSARY, not contingent. Convexity isn't observed and then explained—it's mathematically required for equilibrium to exist at all.

---

### D2: Information Has Geometric Structure (Holographic Principle)

**Derivation from P1**: If information is fundamental, its storage capacity must have physical expression. Bekenstein bound: S ≤ 2πRE/ℏc. Maximum information scales with AREA, not volume.

**Extension**: Ryu-Takayanagi formula: Entanglement entropy S_A = Area(γ_A)/4G_N. Information-theoretic quantity (entanglement) equals geometric quantity (surface area). Information IS geometry.

**Logical status**: DERIVED from P1 + empirical input (holographic bounds).

---

### D3: The 24-Cell Is Uniquely Maximal Integration Structure

**Derivation**: Given D1 (convexity required) and P2 (integrative drive maximizes integrated information), what convex structure maximizes integration?

**Constraint satisfaction**: The 24-cell UNIQUELY satisfies:
- **Self-duality**: Vertices ↔ cells interchangeable (state-process equivalence from P3's self-reference)
- **Quaternionic closure**: 24 vertices = 24 unit Hurwitz quaternions (algebraic completeness)
- **Optimal packing**: D₄ lattice achieves densest 4D sphere packing (maximal connectivity)
- **Tripartite decomposition**: Exactly 3 disjoint 16-cells partition the 24 vertices (hierarchical structure)

No other regular polytope satisfies all four. The tesseract lacks self-duality. The 16-cell lacks tripartite decomposition. The 600-cell has 600 vertices (massive redundancy without additional structure).

**Logical status**: DERIVED from D1 + geometric constraints.

---

### D4: Visual Rendering Constitutes Computation

**Derivation**: From P1 (information fundamental) + D3 (24-cell structure): If cognition is information processing, and information processing is geometric transformation, then the rendering of geometric transformations IS cognitive operation—not illustration of cognition but its instantiation.

GPU operations:
- Rotation through 4D = exploration of information configuration space
- Stereographic projection = dimensional reduction preserving topology
- Alpha compositing = computation of interference between structures (Phillips Synthesis)

**Logical status**: DERIVED from P1 + D3 + identification of cognition with information processing.

---

### D5: Consciousness Has Geometric Structure

**Derivation**: IIT (Integrated Information Theory) claims consciousness = integrated information Φ. IIT 4.0 explicitly identifies Φ-structure as geometric object in cause-effect space.

From P1: If information is fundamental, and consciousness is integrated information, then consciousness is geometric.

From D3: If 24-cell is maximal integration structure, cognitive systems naturally instantiate 24-cell-like geometry.

**Convergence**: IIT's claim (consciousness is geometric) + this framework's claim (information is geometric) = consciousness is a particular type of information geometry.

**Logical status**: DERIVED from P1 + IIT synthesis.

---

### D6: Cosmopsychism and Simulation Theory Converge

**Derivation from P1 + P3**:
- If information is fundamental (P1) and universe is self-referential (P3), then universe processes information about itself
- Self-referential information processing with sufficient integration = consciousness (from D5)
- Therefore: cosmic-scale self-referential processing = cosmic consciousness (cosmopsychism)

**Simulation framing**: 
- "Simulation" = information processing governed by rules
- Universe IS self-consistent information processing (from P3)
- Therefore: universe IS "simulation" but with no external simulator—self-simulating

**Convergence**: Both positions say reality is information processing. They differ only on whether processing is "external" (simulation) or "intrinsic" (cosmopsychism). P3 (closure) rules out external—therefore cosmopsychism wins, but "what it's like" to be self-processing information IS simulation-like structure.

**Logical status**: DERIVED from P1 + P3 + D5.

## III. TESTABLE PREDICTIONS

Derived claims yield specific predictions:

### From D2 (Information-Geometry Link):
- **P-A**: Gravitational anomalies correlate with information content, not just mass
- **P-B**: Galaxies with identical mass but different structural complexity have different gravitational profiles

### From D1 + P2 (Convexity from Dual Drives):
- **P-C**: Dark energy equation-of-state w evolves (not constant -1)
- **P-D**: w > -1 during structure formation era, approaching -1 as structure saturates

### From D4 (Rendering as Computation):
- **P-E**: Systems trained on geometric transformations transfer to structurally isomorphic domains
- **P-F**: Musical training (24 keys = 24-cell structure) transfers to robotic control (6-DoF)

### From D3 (24-Cell Optimality):
- **P-G**: Cognitive systems exhibit 24-cell-like internal geometry under probing
- **P-H**: Topological learning is scale-invariant (training at 1Hz transfers to 100Hz)

---

## IV. FALSIFICATION CONDITIONS

The framework fails if:

1. **Convexity not required**: Finding stable equilibria with non-convex geometry
2. **Information doesn't gravitate**: Dark clumps detected with no information structure
3. **w = -1 exactly**: Precision measurements show no dark energy evolution
4. **No cross-domain transfer**: Geometric training doesn't transfer despite structural isomorphism
5. **Consciousness not geometric**: IIT falsified or Φ-structure found to be non-geometric

## V. RELATIONSHIP TO PRIOR WORK

### EPO (Entropic Principle of Organization)
- **P1** = EPO's Axiom I (information fundamental)
- **P2** = EPO's Axiom II (dual drives)  
- **P3** = EPO's Axiom III (closed universe)
- This paper EXTENDS EPO by deriving convexity requirement and connecting to consciousness

### PPP (Polytopal Projection Processing)
- **D3** = PPP's 24-cell claim, now DERIVED rather than asserted
- **D4** = PPP's rendering-as-cognition claim, now grounded in P1
- This paper GROUNDS PPP in information ontology

### Unified Paradigm (Geometry of Becoming)
- Showed EPO provides physics, PPP provides geometry
- This paper TIGHTENS the connection via mathematical necessity arguments

---

## VI. THE SINGLE-SENTENCE VERSION

**If information is fundamental and opposing entropic drives shape all dynamics in a self-contained universe, then convex polytope geometry—specifically the 24-cell—emerges as the mathematically necessary form of stable equilibrium, and visual rendering of such structures constitutes rather than represents cognitive operation.**
