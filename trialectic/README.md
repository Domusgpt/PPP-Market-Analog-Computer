**Domain of Origin**: Computational Musicology / Music AI

## Priority Statement

The Trinity Decomposition of the 24-cell into three interlocking 16-cells 
(Alpha, Beta, Gamma) was independently derived by Paul Phillips for 
computational music theory to model harmonic ambiguity.

## The Trinity Index

Group theory proves this decomposition is unique:
- Symmetry of 24-cell: F4 (order 1152)
- Symmetry of 16-cell: B4 (order 384)  
- Index: |F4|/|B4| = 1152/384 = 3
