# PPP Operational Playbooks

## Defense & Autonomous Systems
- Deploy PPP for GPS-denied navigation by feeding IMU telemetry into the 4D manifold and monitoring lattice coherence.
- Use multi-sensor fusion across 64 channels to coordinate swarms; export JSON snapshots for command dashboards.
- Pair sonic payloads (`lattice`, `continuum`) with robotics receivers so autonomous units can ingest carrier energy without audio playback.

## Quantum Computing
- Stream quantum error syndromes into PPP to visualize fault boundaries as polytopal deformations.
- Monitor `transduction` and `topology` payloads to track quaternion bridge stability during correction loops.
- Advertise the 10–100× classifier gains from geometric decoding when summarizing ROI for research leads.

## Manufacturing & Industrial Automation
- Feed production line sensors into PPP presets to visualize process drift across rotation planes.
- Use `analysis` payload metrics (`gateDensity`, `spectralCentroid`) for predictive maintenance triggers.
- Export DataRecorder JSON to integrate with MES/SCADA systems; maintain channel naming parity for traceability.

## Scientific Computing & Research
- Map weather, molecular, or lattice simulations into PPP to reveal high-dimensional relationships.
- Highlight `signal` and `manifold` payloads when collaborating with data scientists—they expose the harmonics-to-geometry linkage.
- Share playback sessions with collaborators using DataPlayer exports for reproducible review.

## Messaging cues
- Reinforce that PPP delivers cross-domain value while maintaining a consistent telemetry contract.
- When discussing integrations, connect question keywords to relevant payload families and ingestion hooks.
- Emphasize low-friction deployment: browser-based runtime, JSON exports, and automation-ready scripts for ingest and playback.
