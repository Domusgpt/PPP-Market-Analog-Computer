# PPP Development Timeline

This summary distills the session-by-session notes in `DEV_TRACK.md` so you can cite major milestones without rereading the entire log.

## Foundational runtime (Sessions 01–05)
- **Session 01:** Established the HypercubeCore shell with six-plane rotations and a reusable visualization baseline.
- **Session 02:** Modularized the WebGL runtime, hardened data handling, and documented the `PPP_CONFIG` integration surface.
- **Session 03:** Stabilized uniform pipelines and renderer inspection hooks.
- **Session 04:** Scaled channel capacity to 32 mirrored feeds, preparing for richer sensor arrays.
- **Session 05:** Introduced preset management and aggregation workflows to pivot between sensor configurations.

## Tooling & monitoring (Sessions 06–11)
- **Session 06:** Added mapping JSON import/export tooling for collaborative preset sharing.
- **Session 07:** Embedded live ChannelMonitor diagnostics.
- **Session 08:** Instrumented DevelopmentTracker logging with PPP API helpers.
- **Session 09:** Delivered DataRecorder modules with JSON export and automation hooks.
- **Session 10:** Built DataPlayer playback suites with scrubbing, looping, and uniform snapshot controls.
- **Session 11:** Layered keyboard shortcuts and API helpers for rapid playback navigation.

## Sonic geometry evolution (Sessions 12–23)
- **Session 12:** Introduced the SonicGeometryEngine and resonant lattice.
- **Session 13:** Split harmonic analysis from audible output, enabling silent analytics streams.
- **Session 14:** Added multi-carrier modulation with gating metrics for multimodal transformers.
- **Session 15:** Decomposed rotations into double-quaternion telemetry powering Hopf fiber modulation.
- **Session 16:** Derived spinor harmonic couplers with coherence/braid density telemetry.
- **Session 17:** Built the SpinorResonanceAtlas for per-voice resonance vectors and embeddings.
- **Session 18:** Engineered the SpinorSignalFabric for robotics-grade carrier matrices and bit lattices.
- **Session 19:** Released the SpinorTransductionGrid linking quaternion matrices to sonic carriers.
- **Session 20:** Distilled metrics into the SpinorMetricManifold for aggregated sonic-visual alignment.
- **Session 21:** Added the SpinorTopologyWeave to analyze how rotations energize the sonic lattice.
- **Session 22:** Launched the SpinorFluxContinuum for quaternion/Hopf-aligned flux vectors.
- **Session 23:** Completed the SpinorContinuumLattice with orientation residuals and synergy metrics.
