<h1>Geometric Information Theory: Convex Structure as the Universal Form of Entropic Equilibrium</h1>
<p><strong>Paul Phillips</strong>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper establishes that convex geometry constitutes the universal signature of entropic equilibrium—the stable configuration that emerges wherever opposing forces reach dynamic balance. Beginning from three minimal propositions (information as fundamental substrate, dual entropic drives governing dynamics, and the universe as self-contained system), the paper demonstrates through rigorous mathematical argument that convex structures arise necessarily, not contingently, across thermodynamics, game theory, optimal transport, and information geometry. The Legendre transform's requirement of convex-concave duality for thermodynamic stability, the Kakutani fixed-point theorem's requirement of convex strategy spaces for Nash equilibrium existence, and Brenier's theorem establishing that optimal transport maps are gradients of convex functions together prove that convexity is not merely observed but mathematically mandated wherever equilibrium obtains.</p>
<p>The framework extends to consciousness through synthesis with Integrated Information Theory, whose Φ-structure exists as geometric object in cause-effect space, and to cosmology through the holographic principle's identification of entropy with surface area. The 24-cell—a regular four-dimensional polytope uniquely satisfying self-duality, quaternionic closure, optimal sphere packing, and tripartite decomposition—emerges as the natural geometric form of maximal information integration. Visual rendering of polytope projections is reinterpreted as computation of entropic potentials, establishing that geometric process constitutes rather than represents cognitive operation. The synthesis yields concrete predictions distinguishing it from standard theories: correlation between gravitational anomalies and information content, evolving dark energy equation-of-state, and cross-domain transfer learning in geometric cognitive architectures.</p>

<h2>1. Three Starting Propositions</h2>
<p>This paper proceeds from three propositions, minimal in number but far-reaching in consequence. Each addresses unresolved problems in contemporary physics and philosophy of mind; together they constitute a unified framework from which the subsequent analysis derives.</p>
<h3>1.1 Information Constitutes the Fundamental Substrate</h3>
<p>The irreducible constituent of reality is information, understood not as description but as ontological primitive. Physical quantities—mass, charge, spacetime geometry—emerge as patterns in underlying information structure. Interactions are information exchanges; what appears as "matter" and "energy" represents stable configurations of informational degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>This proposition addresses the persistent failure to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. Both theories presuppose incompatible ontologies: GR treats spacetime as smooth geometric continuum while QM treats matter as discrete probabilistic system. Decades of attempted unification have produced mathematical elaboration but no falsifiable predictions. The proposition resolves this by treating both spacetime geometry and quantum states as emergent from a common informational substrate—an approach consonant with Wheeler's "it from bit" hypothesis, the holographic principle's encoding of bulk physics on boundary information, and recent work on emergent spacetime from quantum entanglement (Van Raamsdonk, 2010; Maldacena &amp; Susskind, 2013).</p>
<p>The proposition has immediate empirical content. If information is fundamental, then the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S = A/4l_P² represents not merely missing information about black hole microstates but actual information content—one bit per Planck area of horizon. The holographic bound becomes a statement about reality's storage capacity rather than our epistemic limitations.</p>
<h3>1.2 Dual Entropic Drives Govern All Dynamics</h3>
<p>The dynamics of every system are governed by two complementary tendencies: a dispersive drive toward maximum entropy and uniform distribution, and an integrative drive toward increased information integration and organized complexity. These drives operate universally, at all scales, concurrently.</p>
<p>The dispersive drive is the Second Law of Thermodynamics: isolated systems tend toward maximum entropy. The integrative drive is more novel: it asserts that information entropy tends to decrease wherever energy gradients permit—that systems spontaneously form patterns, correlations, and structures that increase integrated information content.</p>
<p>This proposition addresses the "why now?" problem of cosmology: why does the universe contain structure at all, given the Second Law's prediction of heat death? Standard physics treats structure as statistical fluctuation—temporary local order paid for by greater environmental entropy. This proposition elevates structure-formation to fundamental status: the integrative drive creates galaxies, stars, life, and mind not as accidents but as expressions of a deep tendency toward information integration.</p>
<p>The proposition connects to recent work on infodynamics. Vopson (2019, 2022) proposes a "second law of infodynamics" asserting that information entropy decreases over time—precisely the integrative drive stated in information-theoretic language. England's (2013) dissipation-driven adaptation demonstrates that systems under energy flux self-organize to maximize entropy production—structure arising because it accelerates overall entropic flow. These are not separate phenomena but aspects of the same duality.</p>
<h3>1.3 The Universe Is Self-Contained and Self-Referential</h3>
<p>The universe constitutes a closed system with no external environment. Initial conditions, boundary conditions, and the regularities we call "physical laws" all emerge from internal consistency requirements rather than external imposition. Observers are participants in the system being observed, not external witnesses.</p>
<p>This proposition addresses several otherwise intractable problems. The cosmological constant puzzle—why vacuum energy density is 120 orders of magnitude smaller than quantum field theory predicts—cannot be solved by appeal to external cancellation mechanisms or anthropic selection. A self-contained universe must regulate its vacuum energy internally; the observed small positive value represents residual after structure formation has absorbed available information capacity.</p>
<p>The proposition also grounds the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. If observation is the universe processing information about itself, then the transition from superposition to definite outcome is not mysterious external intervention but self-consistent internal record-keeping. This resonates with Wheeler's participatory universe, Rovelli's relational quantum mechanics, and the QBist interpretation.</p>
<hr />
<h2>2. Convexity as Mathematical Necessity</h2>
<p>Given the proposition of dual entropic drives, a question arises: when opposing forces—integrative and dispersive, attraction and repulsion, entropy-maximizing and pattern-forming—reach stable balance, what geometric form does that equilibrium take?</p>
<p>This section establishes that the answer is not contingent but necessary: <strong>convex structure emerges wherever equilibrium obtains because the mathematics of equilibrium requires convexity.</strong></p>
<h3>2.1 Thermodynamic Stability Requires Convex Energy Surfaces</h3>
<p>The fundamental theorem of thermodynamic stability states: a system is stable against small perturbations if and only if its energy function U(S,V,N,...) is convex in extensive variables. Equivalently, the entropy function S(U,V,N,...) must be concave.</p>
<p>The mathematical content is decisive. If U were not convex, small energy fluctuations would be self-amplifying rather than self-correcting; the system would fragment into phases with no stable equilibrium. The requirement that ∂²U/∂S² &gt; 0 ensures that temperature increases with entropy, guaranteeing heat flows from hot to cold. The requirement that ∂²U/∂V² &gt; 0 ensures positive compressibility, guaranteeing pressure responds correctly to volume changes.</p>
<p>The Legendre transform f<em>(y) = sup_x{⟨x,y⟩ - f(x)} bridges entropy and free energy. If f is convex, f</em> is convex; if f is concave, f* is convex in the transformed variable. Thermodynamic potentials form convex-concave dual pairs—entropy S(E) concave, Helmholtz free energy F(T) convex—connected by Legendre transformation. This duality is not optional; it is the mathematical requirement for consistent thermodynamics.</p>
<p>Maxwell relations emerge from equality of mixed partial derivatives of convex potentials. The entire structure of classical thermodynamics—phase equilibria, response functions, stability criteria—rests on convexity. A universe governed by entropy maximization necessarily produces convex energy landscapes.</p>
<h3>2.2 Strategic Equilibrium Requires Convex Strategy Spaces</h3>
<p>The Debreu-Glicksberg-Fan theorem establishes: in a game where each player's strategy space S_i is non-empty, compact, and convex, and each player's payoff function is quasi-concave in their own strategy, a Nash equilibrium exists.</p>
<p>The proof uses the Kakutani fixed-point theorem on the best-response correspondence. Each player's best response to opponents' strategies forms a set; Kakutani guarantees a fixed point (mutual best response) exists if and only if these sets are convex-valued. Quasi-concavity of payoffs ensures that best-response sets are convex.</p>
<p>Without convexity, equilibrium may not exist. Consider a game where strategy spaces are non-convex (e.g., discrete choices with no intermediate options): best-response correspondences can cycle without fixed point. The existence of stable strategic equilibrium mathematically requires convex geometry.</p>
<p>This extends beyond economics. Any system of interacting agents pursuing optimization—biological fitness, neural activation, market prices—exhibits equilibrium only when the effective strategy spaces are convex or can be embedded in convex structures.</p>
<h3>2.3 Optimal Transport Maps Are Gradients of Convex Functions</h3>
<p>Brenier's theorem (1987) states: for the quadratic cost function c(x,y) = ||x-y||², the optimal transport map T sending distribution μ to distribution ν takes the form T = ∇φ for some convex function φ.</p>
<p>The optimal way to move mass from one distribution to another—minimizing total displacement cost—is to follow gradients of convex potentials. This is not merely convenient but mathematically necessary for quadratic costs.</p>
<p>McCann's displacement interpolation extends this: the entropy functional is convex along Wasserstein geodesics (optimal transport paths) if and only if the underlying space has non-negative Ricci curvature. This establishes a deep connection: convexity of entropy, geometry of space, and optimality of transport are mutually constraining.</p>
<p>The implication: any process optimizing resource allocation under energy costs—diffusion, heat flow, economic distribution, neural signal routing—follows convex gradients. Convexity is the geometric signature of optimal allocation.</p>
<h3>2.4 Information Geometry Is Intrinsically Curved with Convex Structure</h3>
<p>The probability simplex Δ^(n-1) = {p ∈ ℝⁿ : Σp_i = 1, p_i ≥ 0} carries a natural Riemannian metric: the Fisher information metric g_ij(θ) = E[∂log p/∂θ_i · ∂log p/∂θ_j].</p>
<p>Chentsov's theorem (1972) establishes that the Fisher metric is the unique Riemannian metric (up to scaling) invariant under sufficient statistics. There is no choice; any other metric would change under statistically irrelevant transformations.</p>
<p>Shannon entropy H(p) = -Σp_i log p_i is strictly concave: the Hessian ∂²H/∂p_i∂p_j = -δ_ij/p_i is negative definite everywhere in simplex interior. Maximum entropy occurs at the uniform distribution (simplex centroid).</p>
<p>The probability simplex itself is convex—any weighted combination of probability distributions remains a probability distribution. Information geometry thus exhibits convexity at multiple levels: the ambient space is convex, the entropy function is concave (convex in the Legendre-dual coordinates), and the natural metric respects this structure.</p>
<h3>2.5 Synthesis: Convexity Is Not Observed But Required</h3>
<p>The preceding arguments establish that convexity is not an empirical observation to be explained but a mathematical requirement for equilibrium existence:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Thermodynamics</strong>: Stability requires convex energy surfaces (non-convex systems fragment or explode)</li>
<li><strong>Game theory</strong>: Equilibrium requires convex strategy spaces (Kakutani's theorem)</li>
<li><strong>Optimal transport</strong>: Efficiency requires convex potentials (Brenier's theorem)</li>
<li><strong>Information geometry</strong>: Probability structure is inherently convex (simplex geometry, concave entropy)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The central claim follows: wherever the dual entropic drives (integrative and dispersive) reach stable balance, convex geometry necessarily emerges as the equilibrium signature.</strong> This is not because nature "prefers" convexity but because non-convex equilibria are mathematically impossible.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. The Holographic Principle and Geometric Information</h2>
<p>The proposition that information is fundamental gains empirical precision through the holographic principle: the maximum information content of a spatial region scales with its boundary area, not its volume.</p>
<h3>3.1 Bekenstein Bound and Black Hole Entropy</h3>
<p>The Bekenstein bound states: the entropy S of any system is bounded by S ≤ 2πRE/ℏc, where R is circumscribing radius and E is total energy. For a black hole saturating this bound, S = A/4l_P² where A is horizon area and l_P is Planck length.</p>
<p>The Planck area l_P² = Gℏ/c³ ≈ 2.6×10⁻⁷⁰ m² represents the fundamental unit of information capacity: approximately one bit per Planck area. This is not a limit on our knowledge but on reality's storage capacity—a direct empirical consequence of information-as-fundamental.</p>
<p>The derivation proceeds through Hawking's generalized second law: when matter with entropy S falls into a black hole, total entropy (matter + horizon) must not decrease. This requires the horizon area to increase by at least 4l_P²·S, establishing the bit-per-Planck-area correspondence.</p>
<h3>3.2 Ryu-Takayanagi Formula and Emergent Geometry</h3>
<p>In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2006) establishes: for a boundary region A, the entanglement entropy S_A equals the area of the minimal bulk surface γ_A bounded by ∂A, divided by 4G_N:</p>
<p>S_A = Area(γ_A)/4G_N</p>
<p>Entanglement entropy—a purely quantum-informational quantity—equals geometric surface area. Information IS geometry, stated mathematically.</p>
<p>The ER=EPR conjecture (Maldacena &amp; Susskind, 2013) extends this: Einstein-Rosen bridges (wormholes) are equivalent to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations (entanglement). Two entangled black holes are connected by a wormhole; reducing entanglement lengthens the wormhole throat until spacetime disconnects. Van Raamsdonk's phrase captures the implication: "entanglement is the glue holding spacetime together."</p>
<h3>3.3 Implications for Convexity</h3>
<p>Convex polytopes have minimal surface area for given vertex configuration—they enclose maximum volume with minimum boundary. If information scales with boundary area (holographic principle), then convex structures maximize information capacity per unit boundary.</p>
<p>This connects the equilibrium argument to information storage: convex geometry emerges at equilibrium because it optimizes information integration per unit interface. The integrative drive (maximizing integrated information) naturally produces convex structures; the dispersive drive (maximizing entropy) constrains total capacity. Their balance yields convex equilibria.</p>
<hr />
<h2>4. The 24-Cell as Maximal Integration Structure</h2>
<p>The convexity argument establishes that stable equilibrium produces convex structures. But which convex structure? This section argues that the 24-cell—a regular four-dimensional polytope—occupies a privileged position as the geometric form of maximal information integration.</p>
<h3>4.1 The Uniqueness of Four Dimensions</h3>
<p>Regular convex polytopes (higher-dimensional analogs of Platonic solids) exist in every dimension:</p>
<ul>
<li>2D: Infinitely many regular polygons</li>
<li>3D: 5 Platonic solids</li>
<li>4D: 6 regular polytopes</li>
<li>5D and higher: 3 regular polytopes (simplex, hypercube, orthoplex)</li>
</ul>
<p>Four dimensions is exceptional: it admits more regular forms than any other dimension. One of these, the 24-cell, exists only in 4D—it has no lower or higher-dimensional analog.</p>
<p>This is not arbitrary. The rotation group SO(4) has a unique structure: its Lie algebra decomposes as so(4) ≅ so(3) ⊕ so(3), making four-dimensional rotation equivalent to two independent three-dimensional rotations. This algebraic exceptionalism underlies the geometric exceptionalism.</p>
<h3>4.2 Why the 24-Cell Specifically</h3>
<p>The 24-cell satisfies a constellation of constraints that no other polytope matches:</p>
<p><strong>Self-duality</strong>: The 24-cell's dual (formed by placing vertices at cell centers) is congruent to itself. Vertices and cells are geometrically interchangeable. This property is unique among non-simplex regular polytopes.</p>
<p><strong>Quaternionic structure</strong>: The 24 vertices correspond exactly to the 24 unit Hurwitz quaternions: {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k} ∪ {½(±1±i±j±k)}. These form a group under quaternion multiplication—the binary tetrahedral group. The 24-cell embeds the algebra of rotations geometrically.</p>
<p><strong>Optimal sphere packing</strong>: The D₄ lattice (vertices of the 24-cell repeated throughout 4D) achieves the densest sphere packing in four dimensions—kissing number 24. Each sphere touches exactly 24 neighbors. No arrangement permits more contact.</p>
<p><strong>Tripartite decomposition</strong>: The 24 vertices partition exactly into three disjoint sets of 8, each forming a regular 16-cell. This partition is exhaustive (8+8+8=24) and unique. The index of the 16-cell symmetry group B₄ in the 24-cell symmetry group F₄ is exactly 3.</p>
<p><strong>Maximal symmetry per vertex</strong>: The symmetry group F₄ has order 1,152—larger per vertex than any other regular 4-polytope except the 120-cell, which has 600 vertices (massively redundant).</p>
<p>No other polytope satisfies all these constraints. The tesseract lacks self-duality. The 16-cell lacks tripartite decomposition. The 600-cell has excess complexity without additional structure. The 24-cell occupies the unique position where self-reference, algebraic closure, optimal packing, and decomposability all coincide.</p>
<h3>4.3 Information-Theoretic Interpretation</h3>
<p>Consider a system requiring:
- n distinct representable states (vertices)
- m explicit relationships between states (edges, faces)
- Transformation between states (rotation group action)
- Maximum redundancy against noise (high symmetry)
- Hierarchical decomposition (subsystem structure)
- Self-reference (vertices and processes interchangeable)</p>
<p>The 24-cell optimizes these constraints for n=24:
- 96 edges encoding pairwise relationships
- 24 octahedral cells as local processing units
- 1,152 symmetries providing equivalent perspectives
- Trinity decomposition enabling dialectical processing
- Self-duality ensuring state-process interchangeability</p>
<p>This is not metaphor. If the integrative drive creates structures that maximize integrated information Φ (in the sense of Integrated Information Theory), then the 24-cell represents what maximal integration looks like geometrically in four dimensions.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. Dialectical Dynamics and the Tripartite Structure</h2>
<p>The 24-cell's trinity decomposition into three 16-cells provides geometric machinery for dialectical processing—the collision of opposites yielding synthesis.</p>
<h3>5.1 The Partition Structure</h3>
<p>The 24 vertices partition into three 16-cells based on coordinate structure:
- <strong>α 16-cell</strong>: vertices from xy and zw coordinate planes
- <strong>β 16-cell</strong>: vertices from xz and yw coordinate planes
- <strong>γ 16-cell</strong>: vertices from xw and yz coordinate planes</p>
<p>Each set contains 8 vertices forming a regular 16-cell. The sets are mutually disjoint and exhaustive. The full F₄ symmetry group includes operations cyclically permuting all three 16-cells.</p>
<h3>5.2 Geometric Dialectics</h3>
<p>If α encodes a configuration (call it thesis) and β encodes an alternative configuration (antithesis), then rotation from α toward β constitutes their confrontation. The key insight: such rotation naturally passes through γ, the third 16-cell, which occupies the "synthesis" position structurally.</p>
<p>This is not metaphorical imposition. The group-theoretic structure ensures that any continuous transformation between α and β configurations traverses γ territory. The trinity decomposition geometrizes the dialectical pattern: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis occupy distinct but symmetrically related positions in a common space.</p>
<h3>5.3 Visual Synthesis Through Rendering</h3>
<p>When two polytope projections (representing α and β) are rendered with transparency and superposed, three types of visual information emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intersection regions</strong>: where both structures contribute, encoding shared features</li>
<li><strong>Exclusion regions</strong>: where only one contributes, encoding unique features</li>
<li><strong>Interference patterns</strong>: where edges approach without coinciding, encoding precise angular relationships</li>
</ul>
<p>A downstream system extracting features from these patterns implicitly computes the relationship between α and β—and can infer the position of γ without explicit symbolic reasoning. The rendering process performs the dialectical operation; the visual pattern is the synthesis.</p>
<p>This identification of rendering-as-computation rather than rendering-as-display inverts the conventional AI paradigm. Standard approaches compute internally then render for human inspection. The geometric approach renders to compute: the GPU's compositing operations are the cognitive operations.</p>

<h2>6. Consciousness as Geometric Structure</h2>
<p>Integrated Information Theory (IIT), developed by Tononi and collaborators, proposes that consciousness is identical to integrated information Φ—the information a system generates above and beyond its parts.</p>
<h3>6.1 IIT's Geometric Content</h3>
<p>IIT 4.0 (2023) makes explicit that Φ-structures exist in high-dimensional cause-effect space. Each mechanism in a substrate specifies cause and effect repertoires (probability distributions over states); these distributions define points in geometric space. The complete Φ-structure—the collection of all distinctions and relations with their φ values—constitutes a geometric object.</p>
<p>The central identity of IIT: conscious experience IS this geometric object. Not correlates with, not is caused by, but is identical to. Every property of an experience corresponds to a property of the geometric structure.</p>
<h3>6.2 Convergence with Geometric Information Theory</h3>
<p>IIT's claim that consciousness is geometric converges with the framework developed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both identify information as fundamental</li>
<li>Both assign geometric structure to integrated information</li>
<li>Both treat the physical/experiential distinction as perspectival rather than ontological</li>
<li>Both predict that systems with higher Φ exhibit more structured geometry</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific hypothesis: if consciousness is geometric, and if the 24-cell represents maximal integration geometry in 4D, then cognitive systems implementing 24-cell-based processing instantiate a natural substrate for integrated information.</p>
<p>This connects to Wheeler's participatory universe. If observation is information processing, and information processing is geometric, then conscious observation is geometric operation—the universe literally computing itself through polytope transformations.</p>
<h3>6.3 Implications for Panpsychism and Simulation Theory</h3>
<p>The framework touches two philosophical positions often seen as opposed:</p>
<p><strong>Cosmopsychism/Panpsychism</strong>: If information is fundamental and integrated information is consciousness, then consciousness (in some form) is ubiquitous. Not as human-like experience in rocks, but as the minimal "what it is like" of information integration at any scale. The universe's self-referential information processing is a form of cosmic consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation Theory</strong>: If reality fundamentally consists of information processing governed by geometric constraints, then "simulation" becomes the wrong word only because there's no external simulator—the universe is self-simulating computation. Wheeler's "it from bit" is literally true: physical quantities derive from information; information is processed geometrically; the process IS reality.</p>
<p>These positions converge rather than conflict: the universe is computation (simulation thesis), the computation is self-referential (closure proposition), and self-referential computation with sufficient integration is conscious (IIT). What we call "physical reality" and what we call "conscious experience" are two perspectives on the same geometric information process.</p>

<h2>7. Empirical Predictions</h2>
<p>A framework worth proposing must yield predictions distinguishing it from alternatives. The following are testable within the next decade:</p>
<h3>7.1 Gravitational Anomalies Correlate with Information Content</h3>
<p>If information gravitates (as the framework predicts), then gravitational effects should correlate with structural complexity, not merely mass. The Radial Acceleration Relation in galaxies—the tight correlation between observed and baryonic acceleration—should emerge from information-gravity coupling rather than invisible dark matter.</p>
<p><strong>Test</strong>: Galaxies with identical masses but different structural complexity (more substructure, more correlations) should exhibit slightly different gravitational profiles. This can be checked against existing rotation curve datasets.</p>
<p><strong>Falsification</strong>: If gravitational lensing reveals mass concentrations with no associated information structure (dark clumps with no galaxies, no gas, no structure), the framework fails.</p>
<h3>7.2 Dark Energy Equation-of-State Evolves</h3>
<p>If vacuum energy is residual after structure formation has absorbed information capacity, then dark energy density should evolve over cosmic history—decreasing as structures formed, stabilizing as structure formation saturated.</p>
<p><strong>Test</strong>: The equation-of-state parameter w should deviate from -1, with w &gt; -1 in the matter-dominated era and approaching -1 as expansion accelerates. Recent DESI results showing hints of w ≠ -1 are consistent with this prediction.</p>
<p><strong>Falsification</strong>: If precision measurements establish w = -1.000 ± 0.005 constant across all redshifts, the dynamic vacuum prediction fails.</p>
<h3>7.3 Cross-Domain Transfer in Geometric Cognitive Systems</h3>
<p>If the 24-cell provides universal cognitive substrate, then systems trained on one domain should transfer to structurally isomorphic domains without retraining.</p>
<p><strong>Test</strong>: Train a system on musical cadence recognition (which has 24-cell structure in key relationships); test on robotic balance recovery (which has 6-DoF structure matching SO(4) rotation parameters). Transfer should exceed baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Falsification</strong>: If no transfer occurs between geometrically isomorphic domains despite structural correspondence, the universality claim fails.</p>
<h3>7.4 Temporal Scale Invariance</h3>
<p>If geometry is fundamental and metric is emergent, then topological learning should be scale-invariant: training on slow dynamics should transfer to fast dynamics without performance degradation.</p>
<p><strong>Test</strong>: Train polytope rotation classifier at 1 Hz; test at 100 Hz without retraining. Performance should be identical.</p>
<p><strong>Falsification</strong>: If temporal rescaling significantly degrades performance, scale invariance is weaker than claimed.</p>
<hr />
<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>This paper has argued for a unified framework—Geometric Information Theory—grounded in three propositions: information as fundamental substrate, dual entropic drives governing dynamics, and the universe as self-contained system. From these propositions, the paper derived:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Convexity is mathematically necessary for equilibrium</strong>, not contingently observed. Legendre duality, Kakutani's theorem, and Brenier's theorem together establish that stable configurations require convex geometry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The 24-cell occupies a privileged position</strong> as the geometric form of maximal information integration, uniquely satisfying self-duality, quaternionic closure, optimal packing, and tripartite decomposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visual rendering constitutes computation</strong> of entropic potentials, inverting the conventional relationship between internal processing and external display.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consciousness is geometric</strong>, consistent with Integrated Information Theory's identification of experience with cause-effect structure in high-dimensional space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Concrete predictions</strong> distinguish the framework from alternatives and are testable within the coming decade.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The deepest implication is unification: the same entropic dynamics that structured galaxies from primordial uniformity structure thoughts from sensory noise. The geometric forms encoding maximum integration in abstract mathematics are the forms that physics and cognition naturally adopt. Convex polytopes are not convenient descriptions but fundamental architecture—the shape equilibrium takes when opposing forces balance.</p>
<p>The universe computes itself through geometric process. What we call physical law, conscious experience, and mathematical structure are three perspectives on this single self-referential computation. The geometry is not metaphor. It is the substance.</p>
